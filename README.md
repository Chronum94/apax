- [x] per-example model + `vmap utiliation`
- [x] loading model parameters from TF GMNN
- [x] basic training loop
  - [x] basic metrics
  - [x] hooks / tensorboard
  - [x] model checkpoints
  - [x] restart
- [ ] advanced training loop
  - [ ] MLIP metrics
  - [x] async checkpoints
  - [x] jit compiled metrics
- [x] dataset statistics
- [x] precomputing neighborlists with `jax_md`
- [ ] tests
