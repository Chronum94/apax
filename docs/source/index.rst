===================================================


`apax` is a high-performance, extendable package for training of and inference with atomistic neural networks., most prominently the Gaussian Moment Neural Network.
It is based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and uses [JaxMD](https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md) as a molecular dynamics engine.
