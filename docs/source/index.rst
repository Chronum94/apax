===================================================
apax: Gaussian Moment Neural Networks - in Jax!
===================================================

`apax` is an implementation of Gaussian Moment Neural Networks in Jax. 
It facilitates the training and evaluation of atomistic neural networks, notably GM-NN, for molecular simulations.
Building on top of Jax allows for easy integration with the high-performance molecular dynamics engine `JaxMD <https://github.com/jax-md/jax-md>`_
